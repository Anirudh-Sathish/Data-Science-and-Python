# Lab 9 
## _Task1 Details_
- Classify whether a person is diabetic or not using 
- (a) Minimum distance classifier (Supervised Learning) 
- (b) K- means algorithm (Unsupervised Learning) from the given diabetic.csv file.
- Implement the above using a python program utilizing built-in functions. (buildin.py)
- Implement the above using a python program without using built-in functions to implement (a) and (b).

- FunctionClassification.ipynb consists of the inbuilt function based implementation 
- Revised/HandBuild.ipynb consists of the implementation of K -means and Minimum Distance Classifier without using built-in functions
